This project was developed to exercise my knowledge of REST APIs, databases and their relationships, and Spring Boot.
The idea was to create a program where the user can assemble their order, simulating a supermarket. All the data contained in the MySQL backup was generated by the artificial intelligence of Chat GPT.
