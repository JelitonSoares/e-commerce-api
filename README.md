# üè™ E-commerce
A personal e-commerce project designed to simulate a real-world shopping experience. Users can register clients and products, place orders, and manage inventories.

#  üß± Stack used:

* [*Java*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html) ‚ô®Ô∏è
* [*SpringBoot*](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html) üçÉ
* [*Maven*](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html) üê¶
* [*MySQL*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) üê¨
* [*ChatGPT*](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-mlCY3phIA-docs-gpt) ü§ñ

# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Running Locally:
clone the project
```
  git clone https://github.com/JelitonSoares/e-commerce-api.git
```

You will need:
* Java 17+
* MySQL 8+
* IDE (of your preference)
* Postman/Insomnia to test


First, use the backup file to populate your database, it contains some products, clients and orders already registered, you can add products, clients of your choice and place orders. finally just start the project using your IDE and test with Postman.

# üìö Project Overview:

This project was developed to exercise my knowledge of REST APIs, databases and their relationships, and Spring Boot.
The idea was to create a program where the user can assemble their order, simulating a supermarket. All the data contained in the MySQL backup was generated by the artificial intelligence of Chat GPT, which helped me to optimize the application testing phases and to populate the database with basic data.

# üõçÔ∏è Products Endpoints:
We will start with the products, they are an important part of the program, as we will need them to assemble an order.

## üåü Create a Product

A product is composed of the following fields:
name, description, value, stock and category.
* name: is the abbreviated name of the product
* description: contains all additional information about the product
* value: is its purchase value
* stock: the quantity of this product available
* category: we have some such as: LIMPEZA, HIGIENE, ALIMENTICIOS, PADARIA, ACOUGUE, BEBIDAS, LATICINIOS, UTILIDADES, HORTFRUT and DOCES.


### ‚úèÔ∏è Request:

``` http
POST /ecommerce/products
```


#### Body:
```

    "name": "Espuma de Limpeza Facial Revitalizante Lumina 150ml",
    "description": "Espuma de limpeza facial com microbolhas revitalizantes, que removem impurezas e c√©lulas mortas, deixando a pele macia e luminosa.",
    "value": 39.90,
    "stock": 30,
    "category": "HIGIENE"
}

```

##  üîé Get All Products

All database records will be returned. The project uses a pagination system to optimize HTTP responses, so on each page the system will return 10 products. In this request, the products are displayed in a simplified way, containing only the fields: id, name and description. If you want to see them in detail, use the endpoint to detail a product.


### ‚úèÔ∏è Request:

``` http
GET /ecommerce/products
```

### üïô Response:

A pagination JSON will be returned with some fields:
"content" which contains a list of all records on that page and "page" which contains information about the page such as the number of records per page, current page number, total number of elements (products) in database and the total number of pages

#### Body:
```
{
    "content": [
        {
            "id": "d108275e-7d76-4893-b13f-a64c98e3e173",
            "name": "Espuma de Limpeza Facial Revitalizante Lumina 150ml",
            "description": "Espuma de limpeza facial com microbolhas revitalizantes, que removem impurezas e c√©lulas mortas, deixando a pele macia e luminosa."
        }
    ],
    "page": {
        "size": 10,
        "number": 0,
        "totalElements": 1,
        "totalPages": 1
    }
}
```
### üìÉ Pagination:

Pagination allows the user to customize the response, for example, instead of 10 records per page, it can be configured for 5 or 20 records. Here are some examples of pagination parameters:

Changes the number of records per page:
```http
GET /ecommerce/products?size=5
```
Changes the number of page:
```http
GET /ecommerce/products?page=1
```
among other parameters that can be used to customize API responses.
