You will need:

# 📚 Project Overview:

This project was developed to exercise my knowledge of REST APIs, databases and their relationships, and Spring Boot.
The idea was to create a program where the user can assemble their order, simulating a supermarket. All the data contained in the MySQL backup was generated by the artificial intelligence of Chat GPT, which helped me to optimize the application testing phases and to populate the database with basic data.
